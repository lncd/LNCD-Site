			<h2>LNCD Funding guidelines</h2>
			<p>LNCD was set up to support the objectives of Student as Producer through the research and development of technology for education. Funding is made available by LNCD on similar terms to the <a title="Student as Producer funding" href="http://studentasproducer.lincoln.ac.uk/funding/">funding made available</a> by the Student as Producer project.</p>
			<p>LNCD has an annual budget of £20,000, around half of which we intend to award to staff and students in the form of grants and bursaries to support projects relating to the research, development and use of technology in higher education. We can also help cover the costs of attending relevant conferences and workshops, especially if you have an opportunity to present your work.</p>
			<p>We accept applications for funding at any time of the year and a panel of staff from CERD, ICT and the Library will review them in the time frame given below. We expect to provide funding of around £1000 each to three or four applicants at each submission period.</p>
			<p><strong>2011-2012 schedule</strong></p>
			<p>Applications submitted between September 1st and <strong>October 31st 2011</strong>, will be reviewed by November 15th.</p>
			<p>Applications submitted between November 1st 2011 and <strong>February 28th 2012</strong>, will be reviewed by March 15th.</p>
			<p>Applications submitted between March 1st 2012 and <strong>April 30th</strong>, will be reviewed by May 15th.</p>
			<p>Projects will typically be completed within <strong>three months</strong> of their start date.</p>

			<p><strong>Objectives of funding</strong></p>
			<p>LNCD funding aims to support the implementation of the University’s Student as Producer initiative by encouraging and enabling innovative projects, which focus on the use and role of technology in higher education. Funded projects should result in a tangible output, which improves, showcases or critiques the use and role of technology in the context of higher education. Support will be offered to projects that demonstrate the potential to attract further external funding.</p>
			<p><strong>Applicants</strong></p>
			<p>The fund is open to all students and staff (both academic and professional services). Staff may use project funds to pay bursaries to students for their participation. Students may use project funds to support their academic development.</p>
			<p><strong>Example themes</strong></p>
			<p>Funding applications need to clearly show how they relate to the use and role of technology for education. For example:</p>
			<ul>
			<li>Software development projects that improve the staff and/or student experience of university life</li>
			<li>Prototype services that improve university administration</li>
			<li>Models of support for the use of technology by staff and students</li>
			<li>Theoretical critiques of the role of technology in higher education</li>
			<li>Open Education initiatives</li>
			<li>Relevant workshops and conference papers</li>
			</ul>
			<p>We particularly welcome project proposals that involve collaboration between staff and students or reflect on the role of technology in the teacher/student relationship.</p>
			<p><strong>Use of funding</strong></p>
			<p>Funding may be used for any of the following:</p>
			<ul>
			<li>Release of time from teaching, research or service duties</li>
			<li>Bursaries to students for participation in the project</li>
			<li>Reasonable travel and subsistence costs</li>
			<li>Purchase of hardware and software where there is a demonstrable and relevant outcome of its use.</li>
			<li>Costs of attending relevant conferences/workshops</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Payment</strong></p>
			<p>Payments will be made from CERD to the department/section in which the individual(s) are working. Once the project has been agreed, the Centre will send out a funding contract for signing by the named individual(s), which will give details of the payment schedule and the dates for submitting the final project report and any interim report(s) which may be required. The named individual is responsible for ensuring that the project works within budget, and spending conforms to the financial regulations of the university.</p>
			<p>On receipt of a signed contract, the Centre will allocate the necessary funding. The final report needs to be supported with an appropriate statement of expenditure.</p>
			<p><strong>Application and selection procedure</strong></p>
			<p>Each bid will be considered by a selection panel, which will include representatives from CERD, the Library and ICT. We encourage you to submit clear and concise applications that address the following:</p>
			<p>Student engagement: Is there evidence of student participation in the design, implementation and evaluation of the project?</p>
			<p>Outcomes &amp; Dissemination: Are project outcomes clear, with appropriate plans for sharing and embedding insights learned? How will the project outcomes contribute to the aims of Student as producer and how will project insights be shared?</p>
			<p>Timescale: Is a detailed description of activity over the course of the project offered, with project ‘milestones’ noted, such as the planned dates of key events and/or workshops?</p>
			<p>Aims, Approaches and Activities: Are these clear and realistic, with learning and teaching dimensions made explicit? Is the design and method appropriate to the aims? Are research questions (if any) clearly framed? Are the planned activities detailed, including mention of the staff and students to be involved? Is the project grounded in any of the existing relevant literature?</p>
			<p>Evaluation Plan: Is a thoughtful and costed evaluation plan included, with provision for formative staff/student feedback throughout the course of the project? What types of internal and external evaluation are to be used?</p>
			<p>Budget: Is a realistic and fully-costed budget provided?</p>
			<p><strong>Project commitments</strong></p>
			<p>Each successful project will be required to provide simple progress reports to CERD, and on completion of the project produce a case-study or similar demonstrable output for publication on the LNCD website. In order to facilitate dissemination and maximise impact, there is also an expectation that project participants will maintain a record of progress through a <a title="University blogs" href="http://blogs.lincoln.ac.uk">university blog</a>.</p>
			<p><strong>Deadline for applications</strong></p>
			<p>Applications should be sent by email to <a title="Email Joss" href="mailto:jwinn@lincoln.ac.uk">Joss Winn</a>. Applicants will be notified of the process outcome according to the schedule above.</p>
			<p><strong>Support with submitting bids</strong></p>
