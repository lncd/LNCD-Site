			<h2>What is LNCD?</h2>
			<p>LNCD is a progressive group that includes educational developers, technologists, teachers, researchers and students, and was set up to support the objectives of <a href = "http://studentasproducer.lincoln.ac.uk">Student as Producer</a> through the research and 
			development of technology for education. The work of LNCD is informed by the progressive pedagogy of Student as Producer so as to engender critical, digitally literate staff and students. Core principles of 
			the group are that we recognise students and staff have much to learn from each other and that students can be agents of change in the use of technology for education. LNCD consolidates and furthers on-going 
			collaborative work between the Centre for Educational Research and Development, The Library and ICT Services and extends an open invitation to staff and students from across the university to contribute to 
			the group.</p>
			<p>LNCD offers incentives to people who wish to contribute to the rapid innovation of appropriate technology for education at the university, through work-experience, research bursaries and assistance with
			 internal and external applications for funding. We also provide advice and support for the use of technology in research, teaching and learning.</p>
			<p>LNCD is Not a Central Development group!</p>

			<h2>Past Projects</h2>
			<p>Weâ€™ve worked on an institution-wide space-time service, released an entire course as Open Educational Resources, implemented a cutting-edge datastore, prototyped a semantic publishing platform for document discussion, created a modern single-sign-on system for the university and built tools that make our own work easier to deliver benefits to everyone. We value good design and good data. Many of our projects have been externally funded by JISC, ensuring that we deliver benefits to the university sector too.
