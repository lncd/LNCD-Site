	('chemistryfm','ChemistryFM','April 2009','May 2010','### What was the project about?\n\nThe ChemistryFM project was funded under the HEA/JISC Open Educational Resources Programme. The project released all educational resources used in Year 1 \"Introductory Chemistry for Forensic Science\" (total of 30 credits). The course is designed to cover all the major areas of chemistry (inorganic, organic and physical).\n\nThe 12 month project was led by the Centre for Educational Research and Development, working with colleagues from the Department of Forensic and Biomedical Sciences, Lincoln School of Journalism, Lincoln Business School and Siren FM.\n\n### Why did we undertake the project?\n\nThe university recognises the potential that free and unfettered access to educational resources offers to the local and wider community and welcomed the opportunity to examine how technology and an emerging legal framework can promote creativity and the sustainability of the open educational resources we produce. Our interest in OER is set within a broader framework of debates about pedagogic innovation and the role and nature of universities in the 21st century.\n\n### What did the project achieve?\n\nIn 2008, through internal, competitive bidding, the Centre for Educational Research and Development funded the production of high quality, student-produced videos, which help explain difficult concepts using a mixture of animation and live action. Due to interest from other institutions, the videos are now available under a Creative Commons BY-NC-SA licence. The ChemistryFM project extended this approach to all resources for this course. In addition, we worked with Siren FM, a campus-based community radio station, employing their recording and broadcasting expertise to develop additional multimedia resources with students and apply current online broadcasting methods to the creation and delivery of these materials. All resources have been made available through our JISC-funded Institutional Repository, third-party Web 2.0 services and via a dedicated website. By employing both students and a campus-based enterprise, we tried to demonstrate a sustainable and innovative approach to the development and dissemination of OERs.\n\n### When did the project take place?\n\nApril 2009 - May 2010.\n\n### What did the project cost?\n\n* Total project cost: £48,183.92\n* Funding received: £17,920.60\n\n### Where can I find more information?\n\n* [Project Website](http://chemistryfm.blogs.lincoln.ac.uk/)\n* [Forensic Chemistry course website](http://forensicchemistry.lincoln.ac.uk/)',0,NULL,'HEA/JISC',NULL,'http://chemistryfm.blogs.lincoln.ac.uk/',NULL,0),

At the core of DevXS is a two-day developer marathon, where students are encouraged to team up and build cool things that contribute to university life. It?s about students sharing their ideas, mashing up&nbsp;<a title=\"data.ac.uk\" href=\"http://data-ac-uk.ecs.soton.ac.uk/\">data</a>&nbsp;and building prototypes that improve, challenge and positively disrupt the research, teaching and learning landscapes of further and higher education. Prizes will be awarded to the best ideas, prototypes and collaborations. DevXS builds on the success of the JISC funded Developer Community Supporting Innovation (DevCSI) project and events that it runs, such as the annual&nbsp;<a title=\"Dev8D\" href=\"http://dev8d.org/default.html\">Dev8D conference</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>Who is organising DevXS?</strong></p>\n<p>DevXS is organised jointly by the University of Lincoln?s&nbsp;<a title=\"Student as Producer\" href=\"http://studentasproducer.lincoln.ac.uk/\">Student as Producer</a>&nbsp;project and the JISC-funded&nbsp;<a title=\"DevCSI\" href=\"http://devcsi.ukoln.ac.uk/blog/about/\">DevCSI</a>&nbsp;project, run by UKOLN at the University of Bath. It began as an idea of&nbsp;<a title=\"Nick Jackson on Twitter\" href=\"http://twitter.com/jacksonj04\">Nick Jackson</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a title=\"Alex Bilbie on Twitter\" href=\"http://twitter.com/alexbilbie\">Alex Bilbie</a>, two students at the University of Lincoln who now work in the university?s Online Services Team.</p>\n<p><strong>Who should attend?</strong></p>\n<p>DevXS is open to undergraduate and post-graduate students across the UK and beyond. It?s a conference that?s principally aimed at student web developers, computer science geeks and journalism/media students who are increasingly expected to engage with data on the web. &nbsp;You don?t have to have programming skills to attend, but you should be enthusiastic about working with developers by sharing ideas, pulling together data from various sources and working collaboratively to solve one or more of a number of challenges which will be announced before the start of DevXS.</p>\n<p><strong>When and where is DevXS?</strong></p>\n<p>Friday November 11th, 2011, 4pm ? Sunday 13th November, 4pm.&nbsp;<a title=\"Map of University of Lincoln\" href=\"http://lncn.eu/mt7\">University of Lincoln</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>What is DevXS for?</strong></p>\n<blockquote><p><strong></strong>There is a real opportunity to engage with the energy of those working in ?social technology? to develop new ideas and resources. Individual institutions could run events and become engaged with communities of developers.&nbsp;<em><a title=\"The Edgeless University report\" href=\"http://www.demos.co.uk/publications/the-edgeless-university\">The Edgeless University 2009</a>.</em></p></blockquote>\n<p>The objectives of DevXS are similar to Dev8D,&nbsp;<a title=\"Rewired State\" href=\"http://rewiredstate.org/\">Rewired State</a>&nbsp;and other BarCamp / Hackathon type conferences. DevXS is a continuous 30hr ?hack day?, ?a pressure cooker for innovation ? an intensified period of Research and Development that months of traditional work could not replicate.? It?s intended to provide space, support, incentives and stimulation to students who want to be more than just consumers of university services and build cool tools that make further and higher educational institutions better, learn something in the process and meet other like-minded students across the UK.</p>\n<p>DevXS is a response to what The Edgeless University report called a ?time of maximum uncertainty and time for creative possibility between the ending of the way things have been and the beginning of the way they will be.? At a time when the higher education sector is is undergoing significant change and students are increasingly expected to assume the role of consumer, Student as Producer encourages students to challenge this role through the idea of ?excess? where students, through a critical engagement with their social world, are anticipated to become more than just student-consumers during their course of research and study. DevXS is a disruptive learning experience, a pedagogical intervention for students who want to do cool stuff with the web that challenges the traditional institutions of learning.</p>\n<p><strong>Students: Why should &nbsp;you attend?</strong></p>\n<p>1. You?ll learn a lot. DevXS brings together experts from a broad range of disciplines, so developers learn outside of their narrow subject areas and comfort zones. And the learning is no passive experience ? developers learn by talking, experimenting and sharing.</p>\n<p>2. It?s a good use of your time. The 2 days spent at DevXS represent less than 1% of your academic year. Time spent productively at DevXS will be inspiring and should benefit your studies. The event takes place at the weekend so it won?t disrupt your studies.</p>\n<p>3. It?s excellent for networking. Around 200 people will be attending DevXS ? some working in further and higher education, some developers, some not. Discover what other people in your discipline are doing, and what they?re doing it with.</p>\n<p>4. It?s fun. It?s no secret that many DevCSI events are fun, and that developers love going to them so much so they?ll give up their own time to attend.</p>\n<p>5. It?s free. The event is fully supported by the Student as Producer and DevCSI projects, which means a full programme of great speakers and workshops at no cost to attendees.</p>\n<p>6. Excellent opportunity to talk to future clients, employers and looks impressive on your CV.</p>\n<p><strong>Academics: Why should my students attend?</strong></p>\n<p>1. They?ll learn a lot.

Students will be specifically challenged to design and build systems which harness existing data and platforms to do something useful for universities.<br>\n3. Prestige is up for grabs. Teams who create something cool or win challenge prizes could be up for sector-wide publicity.</p>\n<p>4.

	('embedding-oer','Embedding OER Practice in Institutions','November 2011','October 2012','<strong>What is this project about?</strong></p>\n<p>Higher education is engaging with the wider online culture of open content and seeking to promote the sharing of Open Educational Resources (OER) both by individuals and as a whole institutional approach. Raising awareness of the location and management of OER will be key to embedding the philosophy and practice of OER practice across the University of Lincoln in this HEA/JISC funded project (?50,000) which also involves participation in a HEA Change Academy Programme. The six teams involved in this project will be addressing the advantages of OER and how using and repurposing OER can support different aspects of the student experience.</p>\n<p><strong>Why are we undertaking the project?</strong></p>\n<p>Integral to all six projects will be attention to appropriate digital literacies for staff and students and the promotion of inclusive practice with digital content. Teams will be working alongside the Change Academy to develop ways in which adoption of OER can be promoted strategically and sustainably at an institutional level.</p>\n<p><strong>What will the project achieve?</strong></p>\n<p>Team One</p>\n<p>This team will explore and develop the use of OER to support transition into Higher Education through the provision of resources prior to arrival at University. These will stay available during induction and extend into the first year to help students adapt to the requirements of academic study. The aim is to develop greater understanding of the learning development needs of new students, the range of existing OERs and the tools currently available to produce them, and to repurpose or develop OERs to meet the specific needs across a range of disciplines. Resources will be designed to be customisable, for embedding within a disciplinary context as a whole institution approach.</p>\n<p>Team Two</p>\n<p>Reflection and critical thinking are key to the higher education experience but can pose challenges for new students unaccustomed to examining their own their own learning experiences. The team contains members from a number of different Health and Social Care awards who will be pooling their expertise to investigate how OER can support the processes of critical reflective practice at an early stage in the student learning experience.</p>\n<p>Team Three</p>\n<p>Staff within the School of Social Sciences (Politics, International Relations, Criminology, Social Policy and Social Science) are not particularly aware of OER?s and as a result they are seldom used within the School to impact on student learning. The Criminology in the Professions module has developed a number of resources including a DVD production, podcasts and other useful materials, that might be of value to other courses internally and externally to the university, so it would be useful to investigate how these could be turned into effective OER?s and how these could then best be disseminated through open source environments. Apart from this, all students have to produce materials relating to their own future ?career? development after graduation, as well as producing teaching materials for a seminar that they lead in small groups related to one of a number of practitioner talks. It is thought that some of these materials might have the potential to be developed into useful OER?s.</p>\n<p>Team Four</p>\n<p>This project will look at how open educational resources can support students, practice educators, mentors and university educators on professional programmes in health and social care. The open educational resources will need to address guidance on what is required to build an e-portfolio, reflective writing for professional development and learning in practice, the use of knowledge and evidence in professional practice and critical, analytical writing and ways to draw on and learn from service user?s evaluations of individual practice. Working alongside experts from the HEA Change Academy, the project will look for ways to embed the use of open educational resources to support e-portfolio building and sharing across the university.</p>\n<p>Team Five</p>\n<p>PGCE students have the unique position of being both staff and students and thus have the potential for a dual perspective on embedding OER into their practice. This project will address the differences between virtual face to face teaching and learning and investigate how OER can support staff to establish interaction with online content, manage online collaboration and moderate online discussions. The team will explore the use of OER alongside participation in the Change Academy programme where they will seek ways to promote the use of OER as a whole institution strategy. Surfacing and supporting the appropriate digital literacies for both staff and students will be integral to this project as will raising awareness of inclusive practise with digital resources for teaching and learning.</p>\n<p>Team Six</p>\n<p>Project Six aims to support the other five Lincoln OER teams by developing and distributing useful resources on discovering and adapting open resources for local use and on incorporating open licenses. In addition the team will consider what institutional, national and international repositories will be suitable for resources produced by the project and provide guidance on appropriate granularity and metadata when submitting to those repositories. Finally the project will advise resource authors on using the most effective ways of using existing institutional resources to link their content to their staff profile, or to create a new profile, using appropriate and already available tools.</p>\n<p><strong>When is the project taking place?</strong></p>\n<p>1 November 2011 ? 31 October 2012</p>\n<p><strong>What does the project cost?</strong></p>\n<p>?50,000 funding received (total project cost&nbsp;?86,474.80)</p>\n<p><strong>Where can I find more information?</strong></p>\n<p>Project <a title=\"Project website\" href=\"http://oer.blogs.lincoln.ac.uk\">website</a>',1,NULL,'HEA/JISC',NULL,'http://oer.lincoln.ac.uk/category/latest-news/',NULL,0),

FAST.Q will investigate the use of live feedback technology within the lecture room environment and its impact on teaching and learning. Students will be able to use smart devices (phone, laptops, tablets, etc) to ask questions and provide general feedback during the lecture. This will allow the lecturer to have direct ?real-time? access to these questions and thereby providing an immediate response to the student.</p>\n<p>The Principal Investigator on this project is <a title=\"John Murray\" href=\"http://www.lincoln.ac.uk/socs/staff/2568.asp\">Dr. John C. Murray</a> who works in the <a title=\"School of Computer Science\" href=\"http://lincoln.ac.uk/socs/\">School of Computer Science</a> at the University of Lincoln. The project funds two undergraduate students to work on the development of the FAST.Q system in conjunction with the Principal Investigator.</p>\n<p><strong>Why are we undertaking the project?</strong></p>\n<p>Within the lecture environment, a common situation experienced by lectures takes the form of a lecturer asking ?<em>Does everyone understand that?</em>?, this is usually met my some feeble head nodding and a few students confirming. However, experience tells us that it is not the case that most of the class has fully understood, and in fact many questions are burning away. Indeed this can be attributed to one main factor; the students think all their peers around them have understood, and so do not wish to ask for clarification themselves. Therefore, allowing for students to ask questions via an online ?anonymous? system enables this fear of asking questions aloud to be completely removed and thus allows for clarification, and further questions to be sought by the student.</p>\n<p><strong>What will the project achieve?</strong></p>\n<p>This project will develop an online Q&amp;A system whereby students can ask questions and receive answers in a real-time format. It is hoped that by allowing students the anonymity, from their peers, to feely ask questions this can both improve engagement and attainment in lectures. The FAST.Q tool will be tested and rolled out over the second semester of the 2011/12 academic year, initially within the School of Computer Science.</p>\n<p>It is hoped that the following questions can be answered by the project:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Will the use of FAST.Q increase student engagement?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>- If students are unable to follow the lecture content due to not fully understanding&nbsp;the material and being worried to put their hand up, will the anonymity of FAST.Q allow them to feel more confident asking questions, and ultimately improve their engagement?</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Can the use of FAST.Q help to increase student attainment?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>- If a student?s engagement in lectures drops, due to missing a point on a slide or not&nbsp;quite comprehending a topic, then it could be difficult for them to fully catch up on the materials of the lecture. This could easily cause a snowball effect and the student could potentially drop behind on a module of study. With the use of FAST.Q, allowing students to ask questions and remain engaged, what affect would this have on their attainment within the respective module?</p>\n<p><strong>When is the project taking place?</strong></p>\n<p>January 2012 ?

This is in response to a [call for case studies](http://www.ukoln.ac.uk/web-focus/calls/call-201107/) made in July 2011, which asked for:\n\n> HTML5 case studies and demonstrators which describe best practices and scenarios for making use of HTML5 and related Open Web Platform standards for supporting activities of relevance to those working in the higher and further education sectors.\n\n### Why did we undertake the project?\n\nIn April 2010, Alex Bilbie, an undergraduate student working part-time in ICT, began to develop a \'Common Web Design\' for the university\'s web services. At that time, Alex and a recent graduate, Nick Jackson, were developing *[Posters at Lincoln](http://posters.lincoln.ac.uk)*, a repository and showcase for posters displayed around the university. The decision to develop this service came out of a student focus group about improving student communications. The Online Services Team recognised that the development of *Posters at Lincoln* provided an opportunity to develop a common platform for a new HTML/CSS presentation framework that would gradually unify the look and feel of all internal web offerings.\n\nOver the last year, the CWD has been gradually deployed across the university: e.g. The University [Gateway](http://gateway.lincoln.ac.uk), [Posters at Lincoln](http://posters.lincoln.ac.uk), it is the default theme for the University [Blogs platform](http://blogs.lincoln.ac.uk), the [MyPlayer](http://myplayer.lincoln.ac.uk) streaming media service, [Print from My PC](http://print.lincoln.ac.uk), [My Calendar](http://calendar.lincoln.ac.uk)/Total Recal, <a title=\"Jerome\" href=\"http://jerome.library.lincoln.ac.uk\">Jerome</a>,&nbsp;<a title=\"Linking You\" href=\"http://lncn.eu/toolkit\">Linking You</a>,&nbsp;<a title=\"lncn.eu URL shortener\" href=\"http://lncn.eu\">lncn.eu URL shortener</a>, the&nbsp;<a title=\"Staff directory\" href=\"http://phone.lincoln.ac.uk\">staff directory</a>, the&nbsp;<a title=\"Mobile Gateway\" href=\"http://m.lincoln.ac.uk\">mobile gateway</a>, our in-house&nbsp;<a title=\"MOLE\" href=\"http://lncn.eu/mole\">mobile Blackboard app</a>, our internal access control website for student halls,&nbsp;<a title=\"Student as Producer\" href=\"http://studentasproducer.lincoln.ac.uk\">Student as Producer</a>, and the university&nbsp;<a title=\"Careers\" href=\"http://www.uolcareers.co.uk/\">Careers</a>&nbsp;website .

	('jiscpress','JISCPress','June 2009','July 2010','What was the project about?\n\nThe JISCPress project developed a prototype publishing platform for the JISC funding call and dissemination process. It demonstrated how WordPress Multi-User (WPMU) can be used as an effective document authoring, publishing, discussion and syndication platform for JISC?s funding calls and final project reports.\n\nWork was undertaken by Joss Winn, Centre for Educational Research and Development, Alex Bilbie, ICT Online Services team, Tony Hirst, Open University, and Eddie Tejeda.\n\nWhy did we undertake the project?\n\nWe hoped to provide a means by which JISC project investigators can more effectively discover, and hence build on, related JISC projects. We think that the cumulative effect of publishing this way could lead to an improved platform for the discovery and dissemination of grant-related information and project outputs. In general, the project sought to promote openness and collaboration from the point of funding call announcements onwards.\n\nWhat did the project achieve?\n\nThe JISCPress platform is inspired and informed by WriteToReply, a service developed by the principle project staff (Joss Winn and Tony Hirst) in Spring 2009 which re-published consultation documents for public comment and allowed anyone to re-publish a document for comment by their target community. The project exploited well understood and popular open source technologies to implement an alternative infrastructure that enables new processes of funding-related content creation, improves communication around funding calls and enables web-centric methods of dissemination and content re-use. The platform is extensible and could therefore be the object of further future development by the HE developer community through the creation of plugins that provide desired functionality in the future.\n\nOne of the main outputs from the JISCPress project was the development of digress.it, a plugin for WordPress, which allows readers to comment on documents at the paragraph level. digress.it has since been used by thousands of people and a number of organisations such as the New York Public Library, universities around the world and as the basis for the Regulation Room, a joint project between Cornell University and the Whitehouse.\n\nWe continue to contribute to the development of digress.it, which is open source software available to download for free. Most recently, Alex Bilbie has improved the accessibility of digress.it through the use of better semantic markup. digress.it is available to use on the University of Lincoln WordPress platform.\n\nWhen did the project take place?\n\nJune 2009 to December 2009. May 2010 to July 2010 (Benefits and Realisation funding).\n\nWhat did the project cost?\n\nTotal project cost: £32,466.20.

The videos produced in this project will become valuable teaching resources to demonstrate practical skills to large classes.<br>\nThe second follows feedback from recent focus groups with SLS students that although overall more lab time would be ideal, it was particularly familiarity with lab equipment that was most desired. Therefore being able to view videos in advance of classes in their own time would benefit students hopefully making them more comfortable with lab equipment as well as more technically competent.<br>\nWhile SLS have been producing videos internally, it seems logical to capitalise on the filming/editing skills of CLM students to make this process easier, at the same time providing the students with valuable experience in delivering a professional service.</p>\n<p><strong>What will the project achieve?</strong></p>\n<p>The intended outcomes of this project include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A set of high quality short tuitional videos covering some basic lab skills.</li>\n<li>Videos tagged with the University of Lincoln logo to be uploaded to YouTube&nbsp;under an appropriate Creative Commons License.</li>\n<li>Raw footage and project data files to be archived to make producing more&nbsp;videos considerably easier.</li>\n<li>Valuable experience for all students involved in improving both technical skill&nbsp;and communication skills.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>When is the project taking place?</strong></p>\n<p>Summer 2012</p>\n<p><strong>What is the project cost?</strong></p>\n<p>Total project cost: ?1,000.</p>',1,NULL,'LNCD',NULL,NULL,NULL,0),

However, standard lecturing techniques tend not to convey the true excitement, innovations and practicalities that underpin the research. By way of example Alex Kacelnik tested the notion that animals forage optimally by training nesting starlings to forage from a feeder that was located at varying distances from the nest. To replicate such a study within the confines of both the academic year and the timetable would be virtually impossible, with costs far exceeding the benefits. Thus, this project sets out address this by capturing video footage of real birds foraging for nest material at various distances from the nest.

Working with the challenging requirements of our Engineering research staff and their industry partners, we will apply our experience and understanding of developing university-wide data-driven services to the implementation of a personalised, scalable, resilient and secure research data infrastructure. We intend to meet the requirements of this commercially sensitive research environment as well as to provide the facility to expose datasets through a discovery tool and public APIs made available on our existing http://data.lincoln.ac.uk service.</p>\n<p><strong>Why are we undertaking the project?</strong></p>\n<p>The Orbital project offers a number of benefits to staff and student at the university as well as the university sector and public. Our researchers will benefit from a state-of-the-art research data management infrastructure with supporting training, documentation and policy. Through the re-use and integration with other services, researchers will enjoy a richer, more integrated research environment that helps foster cross-disciplinary collaboration internal and external to the university. Researchers and their partners will be assured that their data is stored and transported securely, conforming to third-party certification where appropriate. A web-based service will provide tools for accessing, querying and downloading the data where appropriate.</p>\n<p>The project is also an opportunity to further learn, develop and embed recently adopted technologies (MongoDB, OAuth, HTML5, etc.) and provide appropriate training to staff outside the immediate project team resulting in broader staff development opportunities. The prestige of this funded project provides us with further leverage to introduce new ideas, technologies and practices in our day-to-day work. We recognise the need for continued innovation in our online services and welcome the opportunity for peer-review that the community engagement and dissemination requirements of externally funded projects bring to our work.</p>\n<p>As with our Institutional Repository project, the Orbital project will provide the opportunity to both develop the requisite policy and technical infrastructure for managing research data at the university as well as lead to institutional change in terms of researcher practices and broadening the skills and experience of our ICT staff. Whereas some of our previous JISC-funded projects have focused on ?rapid innovation?, the remit of the Orbital project is much broader and with high-level endorsement will lead to the long-term adoption of new practices, policy and technologies. The Orbital project will also provide the university with a clearer framework for managing research data, making it more straightforward to provide assurances to funders of our research, such as the Research Councils.</p>\n<p>Where appropriate, data will be publicly accessible from our <a title=\"data.lincoln.ac.uk\" href=\"http://data.lincoln.ac.uk\">http://data.lincoln.ac.uk</a> service, possibly pre-empting the need for FOI requests and ensuring the upmost transparency with regards to our research processes. Consumers of open data will benefit from attractive, well-documented APIs.</p>\n<p><strong>What will the project achieve?</strong></p>\n<p>Orbital will deliver the following:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>A requirements analysis for a pilot research data management infrastructure. This will build on previous work undertaken in the MRD programme, such as ERIM, IDMB and DPM-ESRC projects, paying particular attention to the requirements of ?near-market? research undertaken by our School of Engineering.</li>\n<li>Implementation plans for a pilot research data management infrastructure including a technical plan and a clear indication of the involvement of stakeholders including commercial partner users, Library administration staff and university researchers.</li>\n<li>Development and implementation of a set of services, which re-use and develop our previous JISC-funded work as well as other initiatives (e.g. SWORD and DataCite DOIs).</li>\n<li>Documented open source licensed code will be made available by the end of the project.</li>\n<li>Development and implementation of mechanisms for managing and transferring data, including the use of MongoDB, OAuth, read/write RESTful APIs, SWORD2 interoperability, and integration with the administrative functions of EPrints.</li>\n<li>Policies and guidance aimed at researchers, commercial partners, administrators and the Institution, covering the use and administration of an OAIS-style data archive. Where appropriate, we will re-use the work of previous MRD programme outputs.</li>\n<li>Support: User documentation, monthly and adhoc training workshops. Where appropriate, we will re-use the work of previous MRD programme outputs.</li>\n<li>An institutional data management policy. This will be developed by the Project team, overseen by the Steering Group and proposed to the University?s Research Committee.</li>\n<li>A Business Plan to sustain the infrastructure, presented to the Executive Board.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>When is the project taking place?</strong></p>\n<p>October 2011 ?

The proposed activity will be organised in a similar fashion and initially will be targeted at computing students from different institutions in UK. The project will involve development of appropriate activity tasks that will be the core of the competition.

E-portfolios are a relatively recent phenomenon; there is a&nbsp;paucity of research about their use in professional qualifying programmes such as nursing&nbsp;and social work. However, e-portfolios offer a range of benefits for nascent professionals&nbsp;(Andre, 2010; Murray and Sanders, 2009), including their flexibility and versatility (Garrett&nbsp;and Jackson, 2006) and capacity for storage (Madden, 2007). Successful implementation&nbsp;of e-portfolios is known to have challenges including choice of software and verification&nbsp;of student work by external assessors and mentors (Madden, 2007; Murray and Sandars,&nbsp;2009).</p>\n<p><strong>What will the project achieve?</strong></p>\n<p>The main outcome of this project will be a scoping report that evaluates teaching and&nbsp;learning needs across the two programmes against the current and the potential functionality&nbsp;of WordPress.
